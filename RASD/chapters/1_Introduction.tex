% rising food demand
% climate change
% covid19 pandemic

Over 58 percent of rural Indian households rely on agriculture as their primary source of income, with 80 percent of them being smallholder farmers with less than 2 hectares of land. Furthermore, more than 20 percent of smallholder agricultural households live in poverty. Food consumption is anticipated to climb by 59 percent to 98 percent by 2050, according to the Harvard Business Review \cite{global_demand_for_food}. 

With climate change posing a serious danger to agriculture, a complete overhaul of the system that transports food from farmers to our tables is required. On the top of that, the coronavirus pandemic created a huge disruption in food supply chains, exposing the weak parts of small-scale farmers as well as the significance of constructing resilient food systems.

Telengana is India's 11th biggest state, having a land area of 122,077$km^2$ and a population of 35,193,978 people (data from 2011) \cite{telengana}. \textbf{DREAM}'s goal is to help Telenganaâ€™s government promote data-driven policymaking in the state by designing, developing, and demonstrating anticipatory governance models for food systems utilizing digital public goods and community-centric approaches \cite{reference_doc}.

\subsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Strengthen data-driven policymaking in Telengana.
    \item Allow assessment of performance of the farmers in accordance to the external factors.
    \item Ensure regular support of farmers by agronomists.
    \item Allow farmers to exchange their knowledge.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{World Phenomena}

\begin{itemize}
    \item [\textbf{WP.1}] Data concerning meteorological short-term and long-term forecasts are being collected by Telegana's government \cite{tsdps}.
