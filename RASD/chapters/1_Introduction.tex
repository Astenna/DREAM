% TODO: To introduce some background based on the Context.

% rising food demand
% climate change
% covid19 pandemic

Over 58 percent of rural Indian households rely on agriculture as their primary source of income, with 80 percent of them being smallholder farmers with less than 2 hectares of land. Furthermore, more than 20 percent of smallholder agricultural households live in poverty. Food consumption is anticipated to climb by 59 percent to 98 percent by 2050, according to the Harvard Business Review \cite{global_demand_for_food}.

With climate change posing a serious danger to agriculture, a complete overhaul of the system that transports food from farmers to our tables is required. On the top of that, the coronavirus pandemic created a huge disruption in food supply chains, exposing the weak parts of small-scale farmers as well as the significance of constructing resilient food systems.

Telangana is India's 11th biggest state, having a land area of 122,077$km^2$ and a population of 35,193,978 people (data from 2011) \cite{telangana}. The project's goal is to help Telangana’s government promote data-driven policy-making in the state by designing, developing, and demonstrating anticipatory governance models for food systems utilizing digital public goods and community-centric approaches \cite{reference_doc}.

\subsection{Goals} \label{subsec:goals}
\begin{itemize}
	\item [\textbf{G1.}] Acquire, combine, and visualize data from external systems and users.
	\item [\textbf{G2.}] Facilitate performance assessment of the farmers.
	\item [\textbf{G3.}] Ensure regular support of farmers by agronomists.
	\item [\textbf{G4.}] Enable farmers to exchange their knowledge.
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope}

Data dRiven PrEdictive FArMing (DREAM) is a project that intends to redesign the food production process in the Telangana area in order to create more resilient agricultural systems that will be required to meet the region's rising food demand. To address such a broad issue, it is critical to bring together individuals from many professions and backgrounds; hence, the participation of groups such as stakeholders, policy makers, farmers, analysts, and agronomists is desirable.

Data acquisition and combination can be viewed as the first feasible step in achieving the goal. This information might be gathered from farmers, specialized sensors installed on the ground that detect soil humidity, and government agronomists who visit fields on a regular basis.

The system aims to enable policy makers to identify farmers who perform well, especially under tough weather conditions, farmers who perform particularly badly and require assistance, and understand if agronomist-led steering initiatives yield substantial outcomes. This is going to be achieved by continuous assessment based on the visualizations of the acquired data.

Another group that would benefit from the system are the farmers, since it will allow them to exchange good practices between each other and request help when needed. All of that will be supplemented with visualizations of relevant data, including suggestions and weather forecasts.

The project also intends to facilitate the work of agronomists by creating a daily plan for field visits, giving statistics on farmers' performance, and informing them about incoming assistance requests.

The system attempts to address a highly difficult topic, which necessitates the coordination of numerous individuals. All of these criteria requires the system to be very easy to use, intuitive, and straightforward, so that everyone can get the most out of it.
