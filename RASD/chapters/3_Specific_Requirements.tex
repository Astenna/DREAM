\section{External Interface Requirements}

\subsection{User Interfaces}
DREAM is a web application. It might be used on various devices, regardless of their form factor. 
However, the application is predicted to be primarily used on desktops. As such, the following mock-ups show visualizations of the desktop version of the application. Due to the large number of possible views and combinations, only the most important ones are included. The goal of the mock-ups is to visualize functionality, as such the final views may differ in details such as colors or the element placement.

\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}
DREAM is a web application, as such each user should own a device capable of installing a modern browser. Form factor of the device does not matter, as DREAM application is fully responsive.

\subsection{Software Interfaces}
A modern browser is necessary to use the system. DREAM supports most major browsers. However, in order to ensure full functionality, below is a list of browsers that are fully supported.
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Google Chrome
    \item Firefox
    \item Safari
    \item Microsoft Edge
    \item Opera
\end{itemize}
User should always update their browser to keep up with security, compatibility and functionality.

\subsection{Communication Interfaces}
To perform any kind of operation using the system, a stable internet connection is required (Wi-Fi or cellular).

\section{Performance Requirements} \label{sec:performance_requirements}

Given that the system is intended for Telangana farmers, agronomists, and policymakers, it is fair to assume that it will be utilized by about 30 000 people. Therefore, the following performance requirements, which were formulated taking into consideration the best practices \cite{performance_requirements}, should be met.

\subsection{Response Time}

\begin{itemize}
    \item During peak hours, the average response time should be 2 seconds.
    \item During peak hours, 99\% of all response times must be shorter than 3 seconds.
    \item In each 10-minute period commencing on the hour, the average response time must be 2 seconds or less.
    \item 95\% percent of all response times must be shorter than 2 seconds.
\end{itemize}
 
\subsection{Workload}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The system must be capable of processing 20 transactions per second.
    \item The system must have no more than one hour of downtime every three months.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scalability}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The system must be able to sustain a 5\% yearly growth in new users.
    \item The system must be able to sustain a 10\% yearly increase in the number of transactions per second.
    \item The system shall be able to extend its connections to new external systems providing relevant data as their number may arise.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Platform}

DREAM has to be housed on a platform that meets the following criteria:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Operating system: Windows 10 or Windows 11.    
    \item \textit{.NET 6.0} development platform installed.
    \item \textit{PostgreSQL} object-relational database system.
    \item CPU: 1.4 GHz 64-bit processor compatible with x64 instruction set.
    \item Memory: Minimum 8 GB of RAM. 
    \item Hard drive space: minimum of 20 GB of space.
    \item Network adapter: an Ethernet adapter capable of at least 1 gigabit per second throughput.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Constraints}

This section describes the constraints of a design. These include uncontrolled limitations that are self-imposed in order to enhance the design.

\subsection{Standards compliance}

The system will collect data from external systems and sensors, as well as data entered by users during registration and application use, such as production data, agronomist's daily plan, farmer's summary, and notes. The data will be used exclusively for system purposes and will be treated discreetly in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation \cite{GDPR} and IS 17428.1 \cite{india_privacy_doc} guidelines. In particular, no information relating to a specific person will be made public as a result of the statistical analyses undertaken.

\subsection{Hardware limitations}

The following are the hardware constraints that the end user must meet in order to use the system.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Processor: 1.9 GHz x86- or x64-bit dual-core processor.
    \item Memory: 2 GB of RAM.
    \item Network: wired or wireless connection with bandwidth greater than 40 KBps (320 kbps) and latency under 200 ms.
    \item Web browser: Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, or Opera running on Windows, macOS, Linux, or mobile operating systems including Android and iOS, with \textit{JavaScript} enabled.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Any other constraints}

DREAM will employ stateless protocols to enable components to be handled and changed without impacting the overall system. Additionally, the system will catalog, retrieve and run queries on all the relevant data using a relational database.

\section{Software System Attributes}

The system's characteristics that facilitate the measurement of its performance are presented in this section.

\subsection{Reliability}

The mean time between failures shall be equal to 120 hours, which means that in the worst case scenario it may break once every 5 days. Furthermore, the system shall be fault-tolerant, with its architecture prepared for any potential damage to system components by having replicas ready to be substituted. In order to recover from eventual data losses, redundancy should be considered for the system's database implementation.

\subsection{Availability}

As mentioned in the section \ref{sec:performance_requirements}, the system shall have no more than one hour of downtime every three months, thus, shall be highly available. In case of any planned maintenance works, all the users should be notified at least 48 hours in advance.

\subsection{Security}

The system shall implement role-based access control, which is a method of restricting system access to authorized users and granting permissions based on the user's role. It is accomplished through the use of both authentication and authorization implemented in the backend. The former is based on verifying the identity of a user, which can be an agronomist, a farmer, or a policy maker, during the log in phase. The latter, on the other hand, validates the logged-in user's permissions to perform an action (for example, visualizing an agronomist's daily plan) before actually carrying it out. The system uses a pseudo-random number generator based on HMACSHA1 to implement password-based key derivation capabilities, PBKDF2. \cite{Rfc2898DeriveBytes}.

\subsection{Maintainability}

The system shall be written in a widely known programming language, which would ensure a high level of maintainability and a relatively simple induction for potential new members of the development team. Following that, it should be divided into modularized components to ease replacements and fixes in the event of a failure. The system's backend must be capable of supporting maintenance works on a copy, which will subsequently be deployed after being tested on pre-defined test suites, in order to ensure no downtime for the core functionalities.

Both the testing scenarios and the tests themselves should be defined. This contains both end-to-end testing and basic unit tests. The code coverage should then be monitored and controlled. In the event of a system failure, thorough crash reports must be sent to the developers.

Maintenance pauses will be arranged on occasion throughout the night, when user traffic is at its lowest.

\subsection{Portability}

DREAM will be offered as a web application, making it available on the vast majority of current web browsers, including desktop and mobile machines. Because of this approach, the system will be usable on a wide range of devices. User interface adjustments shall be made to make the application user-friendly on all the environments.
