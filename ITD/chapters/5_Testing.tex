\section{System Testing}

System tests are performed to ensure that the whole system is working properly. They are performed in a controlled environment, such as a virtual machine, and are usually performed by a testing team.

System tests were written in \textit{python} using \textit{pytest} \cite{pytest} and \textit{Selenium WebDriver} \cite{selenium} frameworks.
