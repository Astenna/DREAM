\chapter{Testing} \label{ch:testing}

As stated in the DD, the project verification approach was planned to be centered on three different types of tests: unit, integration, and system tests. In the end, however, unit tests were omitted in favor of gaining more time for detailed integration and system tests.

Furthermore, \textit{GitHub Actions} was the platform utilized for continuous integration. The analysis of the correctness of the code, its format, building it on a container designed for this purpose, and the automated firing of tests with each new code delivery substantially enhanced project quality management. As a result, the faulty or unstable code was unable to be pushed to the main repository branch. All the developed tests were triggered by each push to a release branch, pull request to the main branch, or just manually.

\section{Integration Testing}
The integration testing were performed manually and were focused on Server's API testing using swagger interface. The test cases are described below. For the sake of brevity, the test cases descriptions of GET endpoints were omitted since they were tested together with corresponding POST, DELETE and PUT endpoints.

\section{System Testing}

System tests were designed to ensure that the whole system is working properly. They were performed in a controlled environment, with both the client and server running in the background.

System tests were written in \textit{Python} using \textit{pytest} and \textit{Selenium WebDriver} frameworks. These two allowed to test the entire system in a fully automated manner. The following sections describe the implemented test cases, which match the system's use cases previously defined in RASD.
