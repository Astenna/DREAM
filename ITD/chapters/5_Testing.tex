\chapter{Testing} \label{ch:testing}

As stated in the DD, the project verification approach was centered on three different types of tests: unit, integration, and system tests. Each one addressed a different level of system abstraction.

Furthermore, \textit{GitHub Actions} was the platform utilized for continuous integration. The analysis of the correctness of the code, its format, building it on a container designed for this purpose, and the automated firing of tests with each new code delivery substantially enhanced project quality management. As a result, the faulty or unstable code was unable to be pushed to the main repository branch. All the developed tests were triggered by each push to a release branch, pull request to the main branch, or just manually.

\section{System Testing}

System tests were designed to ensure that the whole system is working properly. They were performed in a controlled environment, with both the client and server running in the background.

System tests were written in \textit{python} using \textit{pytest} \cite{pytest} and \textit{Selenium WebDriver} \cite{selenium} frameworks. These two allowed to test the entire system in a fully automated manner. The following sections describe the implemented test cases, which match the system's use cases previously defined in RASD.
