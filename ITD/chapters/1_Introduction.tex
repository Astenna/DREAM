\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}

The purpose of this document is to present the work done during the implementation of the Data-dRiven PrEdictive FArMing in Telangana (\textit{DREAM}) application's initial prototype. It follows the directives and instructions specified in the \textit{I\&T assignment goal, schedule, and rules} \cite{reference_doc2}. A thorough backdrop together with problem definition may be found in the \textit{Requirement Engineering and Design Project: goal, schedule, and rules} document \cite{reference_doc}.

\section{Scope}

Implementation and Test Deliverable (\textit{ITD}) provides an overview of the languages and frameworks utilized during development as well as a synopsis of the functionalities accessible in the current version of the program.

Furthermore, described here are: the created code, a document outlining the structure of the code, the development frameworks used, installation instructions, and information on how software tests were performed.

This document, together with the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (\textit{RASD}) \cite{rasd} and the Design Document (\textit{DD}) \cite{dd}, is intended to inform on the completion of the \textit{DREAM} application.
