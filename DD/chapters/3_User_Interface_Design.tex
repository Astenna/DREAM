    DREAM is a web-based application. It could be utilized on a variety of devices, independent of form factor. The application, however, is expected to be largely utilized on desktop computers. As a result, the given mockups depict representations of the application's desktop version.
    
    This chapter provides pictures of all the  mockups, that will be later used for the requirements traceability (see chapter \ref{ch:requirements_traceability}).
    
    \subsubsection{Unregistered user}

    By clicking on the \textit{Daily plan} button, the agronomist can display his visit calendar and plan for the chosen day. The agronomist can see if he has submitted execution state for the given day: if the day has a green dot on the calendar, it means that the agronomist has realized all his planned visits.
