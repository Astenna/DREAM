\chapter{Introduction}

The focus of this document is to present the work done during testing of the Data-dRiven PrEdictive FArMing in Telangana (\textit{DREAM}) application's initial prototype, implemented by another group of students. The project was carried out in accordance with the directives and instructions outlined in the \textit{I\&T assignment goal, schedule, and rules} \cite{reference_doc2}. The \textit{Requirement Engineering and Design Project: goal, schedule, and rules} document \cite{reference_doc} provides a full background as well as a thorough overview of the problem.
