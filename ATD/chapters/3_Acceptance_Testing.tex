\chapter{Acceptance Testing} \label{ch:acceptance_testing}

\todo{Add description of the chapter.}
% Mention that the application was tested manually.

\section{Project Specifics}

Goals, use cases, as well as functional requirements that are defined throughout the RASD document are listed below. They are further exploited to define particular test cases in the process of acceptance testing. Since the functionalities were implemented to satisfy only the needs of agronomists and farmers, all the information related to the role of a policy maker is crossed out.

\subsection{Goals}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item [\textbf{G1.}] Allowing farmer to share their knowledge and problems with other farmers and help them with their farm by creating and commenting a topic.

	\item [\textbf{R20.}] The system allows the farmers to visualize the \textit{knowledges} shared by their agronomist.
	\item [\textbf{R21.}] The system allows all agronomists to check the weather forecasts for their area.
	\item [\textbf{R22.}] The system allows the agronomists to publish a grade for each farmer after each visit.
	\item [\textbf{R23.}] \sout{The system allows the policy makers to view the grades of all farmers of Telangana.} (\textbf{Not implemented.})
	\item [\textbf{R24.}] The system requires a sign up and a login to access to the data.
	\item [\textbf{R25.}] The system shows to each agronomist the list of all farmers they are responsible for.
	\item [\textbf{R26.}] The system notifies the agronomists when a new farmer has registered under their area.
	\item [\textbf{R27.}] The system allows the farmer to insert their position when they first register.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Test Cases}

The following test cases are used in the process of acceptance testing of the initial prototype of the DREAM system. The test cases are based on the project's use cases, which are additionally mapped to the functional requirements and so that the fulfillment of both is verified.
